Renders markdown, jade, or any templated files as posts, tag it up with metadata that's passed into any view engine you want, instant pagination, tag and category views, and home in time for dinner.\n\nView the source for [jsantell.com](https://github.com/jsantell/jsantell.com) to see an example of Poet in use. Much `<3` to [Brittany Fedor](http://bfedor.com/) for the sweet art!\n\n![The Node Poet](https://raw.github.com/jsantell/poet/gh-pages/img/poet.png)\n\n## Documentation\n\nFull documentation for *Poet* can be found at [http://jsantell.github.com/poet](http://jsantell.github.com/poet)\n\n## Poet In Action\n\nThese sites are using Poet for their blogging, check them out!

(default: `<!--more-->`)\n\n## Posts\n\nPosts are constructed in markdown, jade, or any templated language of your choice (read [docs](http://jsantell.github.com/poet#format)), prefixed by front matter via [YAML](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/YAML-Front-Matter) or [JSON](https://github.com/jsantell/node-json-front-matter).
