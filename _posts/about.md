I recently thought to myself while buying a $10 8 oz. bottle of linseed oil, I'm tired of getting ripped off by these pretentious art stores who overcharge you just because they can. I decided to check out the lineseed oil at a hardware store by my house. I was pleasantly surprised when I realized I could get nearly 4 times as much for the same price.

A lot of people are scared to use this stuff because it supposedly isn't real "linseed oil", but I looked up the ingredients for the Keal Strip brand and it said it was 95-100% pure linseeed oil. Good enough for me. It's not like I'm a *real artist* or anything (whatever that means). I just like to make pretty pictures- some prettier than others.
Anyway, here is my first attempt at using this stuff.

Looks kind of like a scab, Oh well it was fun. It is slightly more of a honey color it seems than the artist grade but I like it. It's oily and that's all that matters.
